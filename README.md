# a/b testing
 Run an A/B test to see which marketing promotion drives the most sales. 


### Working in the Consumer Packaged Goods industry, I understand that promotional campaigns and trade spending are critical to driving competitive advantage and generating a lift in sales. Since these promotional campaigns require substantial funding and effort, it is imperative to run them at the right time, place, and price point. Especially for new product releases, innovation funding is key to understanding if new products will become part of the permanent portfolio. 

### In this project, I will be using this <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/chebotinaa/fast-food-marketing-campaign-ab-test">fast food campaign data</a> to run an A/B test and determine which of the three promotional campaign drives the most sales for a new menu item. 


## Conclusion and Recomendation 

### Based on our exploratory analysis and the results of the two sample t test, we reccomend that this fast food chain runs promotion 3 in small and medium markets and promotion 1 in large markets. 

### However, there are two things we should investigate further if possible. First, the dataset did not give any details on geography. Not all geographies behave the same, so it is possible that this recommendation will miss some nuances. Second, the dataset did not provide any information on the sale of other items. We need to take into account the cannabalization of sales of the existing products as a result of introducing a new product.
